An Handwritten character recognition system that can recognize various handwritten characters or alphabets. 
Used keras module from tensorflow for implementing the neural network . As an activation function for the neural network relu is leveraged to adjust the weight and bias .
Softmax function is used at the ouptput layer for getting the correct output.
The Character recognition task can be efficiently carried out by the CNN(Convo neural network) which is specifically used for image identification.
